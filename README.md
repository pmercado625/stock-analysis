# Stock Analysis Program
## Overview of Project
This project was created in order to assist in analyzing a dataset for stocks. By taking data from each stock ticker, this project can provide insight into various facets of the stock, such as the returns and the total volume traded. The project was then rehashed inorder to refactor the code into a more efficient process and then comparing the original with the refactored code.

## Results

![2018 stocks results](https://github.com/pmercado625/stock-analysis/blob/main/stock_performance_2018.png?raw=true)  


In comparing the success of this group of stocks, it's very apparent that most stocks ended up doing worse for themselves with the exceptions of ENPH and RUN which experienced fantastic growth from 2017 to 2018.

Above is a side by side comparison of the new code to old code, respectively. As one can see, there is an entire magnitude of difference in time in favor of the refactored code to complete the same task.

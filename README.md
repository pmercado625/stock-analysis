# Stock Analysis Program
## Overview of Project
This project was created in order to assist in analyzing a dataset for stocks. By taking data from each stock ticker, this project can provide insight into various facets of the stock, such as the returns and the total volume traded. The project was then rehashed inorder to refactor the code into a more efficient process and then comparing the original with the refactored code.
